# Monk's Sound Enhancements
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT

This is some enhancements to the way Foundry handles playlist and sounds

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
Pressing the page number on the standard Hotbar will expand all Hotbar rows, and allow you to drag and drop on any of the rows.
It will allow you to directly pick the row you wish to see by clicking the number beside the expanded rows, rather than paging to it.
And clicking the trash can will allow you to clear an entire row of macros.

## Sound List

![monks-sound-enhancements](/screenshots/list.png)

When you open up a playlist configuration, a second tab has been added that will list all the sounds associated with that play list.  This is most helpful when viewing a playlist that is in a compendium as you can now see what sounds are associated with the playlist before importing it.

A play button has been added so you can listen to the sound file personally without needig to play it through the Plalist interface and possibly broadcasting it to the players.

You can drag and drop individual sound files onto play lists.  So you can view a playlist within a compendium, listen to the sound file, and if it's one you'd like to include you can drop it into an active playlist.

Also, if you are importing from a compendium, there will be checkboxes available to individually select files you wish to be included when you import the playlist.  So you no longer need to import the entire list if you only want to include a few tracks.
